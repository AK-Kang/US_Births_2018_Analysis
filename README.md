# DATA 102, Fall 2022, Final Project
An analysis of mothers' smoking habit, personal data, and other prenatal conditions on babies' weights.

## Introduction

In this project, we use the US births 2018 dataset to analyze what may be influencing babies' birth weights. Causal inference and GLMs (generalized linear models) techniques are employed to help us obtain quantitative data.  

## Methods

To determine a relationship between cigarettes and birth weights, we apply causal inference, including observational studies, outcome regression, and IPW (inverse propensity weighting).

To predict babies' birth weights from mothersâ€™ age and number of prenatal visits, we compare GLMs to nonparametric methods using k-nearest neighbors and decision trees.
